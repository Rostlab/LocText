          <p id="s2p1">Cementum is a unique mineralized connective tissue that covers the root surfaces of the teeth. The cementum is critical for appropriate maturation of the periodontium, both during development as well as that associated with regeneration of periodontal tissues, IU; however, one major impediment to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate periodontal regeneration is the lack of cementum markers. Here we report on the identification and characterization of one such differentially human expressed gene, termed &quot;cementum protein-23&quot; (CP-23) that appears to be periodontal ligament and cementum-specific. We screened human cementum tumor-derived cDNA libraries by transient expression in COS-7 cells and &quot;panning&quot; with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a cementoblastoma conditioned media-derived protein (CP). One isolated cDNA, CP-23, was expressed in E. coli and polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant human CP-23 were produced. Expression of CP-23 protein by cells of the periodontium was examined by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. Expression of CP-23 transcripts in human cementoblastoma-derived cells, periodontal ligament cells, human gingival fibroblasts and alveolar bone-derived cells was determined by RT-PCR. Our results show that we have isolated a 1374-bp human cDNA containing an open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide with 247 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 25.9 kDa that represents CP species. The recombinant human CP-23 protein cross-reacted with antibodies against CP and type X collagen. Immunoscreening of human periodontal tissues revealed that CP-23 gene product is localized to the cementoid matrix of cementum and cementoblasts throughout the entire surface of the root, cell subpopulations of the periodontal ligament as well as cells located paravascularly to the blood vessels into the periodontal ligament. Furthermore, 98% of putative cementoblasts and 15% of periodontal ligament cells cultured in vitro expressed CP-23 gene product. Cementoblastoma cells and periodontal ligament cells contained a 5.0 kb CP-23 mRNA. In situ hybridization showed strong expression of CP-23 mRNA on cementoblast, cell subpopulations of the periodontal ligament and cells located around blood vessels into the periodontal ligament. Our results demonstrate that CP-23 represents a novel, tissue-specific-gene product being expressed by periodontal ligament subpopulations and cementoblasts. These findings offer the possibility to determine the cellular and molecular events that regulate the cementogenesis process during root development. Furthermore, it might provide new venues for the design of translational studies aimed at achieving predictable new cementogenesis and regeneration of the periodontal tissues.</p>
