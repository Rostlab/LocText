          <p id="s2p1">MHC-related protein (MR)1 is an MHC class I-related molecule encoded on chromosome 1 that is highly conserved among mammals and is more closely related to classical class I molecules than are other nonclassical class I family members. In this report, we show for the first time that both mouse and human MR1 molecules can associate with the peptide-loading complex and can be detected at low levels at the surface of transfected cells. We also report the production of recombinant human MR1 molecules in insect cells using highly supplemented media and provide evidence that the MR1 H chain can assume a folded conformation and is stoichiometrically associated with beta(2)-microglobulin, similar to class I molecules. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that surface expression of MR1 is possible but may be limited by a specific ligand or associated molecule.</p>
