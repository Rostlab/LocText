          <p id="s2p1">Vacuoles perform a multitude of functions in plant cells, including the storage of amino acids and sugars. Tonoplast-localized transporters catalyze the import and release of these molecules. The mechanisms determining the targeting of these transporters to the tonoplast are largely unknown. Using the paralogous Arabidopsis thaliana inositol transporters INT1 (tonoplast) and INT4 (plasma membrane), we performed domain swapping and mutational analyses and identified a C-terminal di-leucine motif responsible for the sorting of higher plant INT1-type transporters to the tonoplast in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. We demonstrate that this motif can reroute other proteins, such as INT4, SUCROSE TRANSPORTER2 (SUC2), or SWEET1, to the tonoplast and that the position of the motif relative to the transmembrane helix is critical. Rerouted INT4 is functionally active in the tonoplast and complements the growth phenotype of an int1 mutant. In Arabidopsis plants defective in the Î²-subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex, INT1 is correctly localized to the tonoplast, while sorting of the vacuolar sucrose transporter SUC4 is blocked in cis-Golgi stacks. Moreover, we demonstrate that both INT1 and SUC4 trafficking to the tonoplast is sensitive to brefeldin A. Our data show that plants possess at least two different Golgi-dependent targeting mechanisms for newly synthesized transporters to the tonoplast.</p>
