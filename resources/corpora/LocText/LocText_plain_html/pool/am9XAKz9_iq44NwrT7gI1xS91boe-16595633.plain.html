          <p id="s2p1">alpha-Synucleinopathies are a group of neurological disorders characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusion bodies containing alpha-synuclein. We previously demonstrated that synphilin-1 interacts with alpha-synuclein, implying a role in Parkinson's disease. We now report the identification and characterization of synphilin-1A, an isoform of synphilin-1, which has enhanced aggregatory properties and causes neurotoxicity. The two transcripts encoding synphilin-1A and synphilin-1 originate from the SNCAIP gene but differ in both their exon organization and initial reading frames used for translation. Synphilin-1A binds to alpha-synuclein and induces the formation of intracellular aggregates in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, primary neuronal cultures, and human dopaminergic cells. Overexpression of synphilin-1A in neurons results in striking cellular toxicity that is attenuated by the formation of synphilin-1A inclusions, which recruit alpha-synuclein. Synphilin-1A is present in Lewy bodies of patients with Parkinson's disease and Diffuse Lewy Body disease, and is observed in detergent-insoluble fractions of brain protein samples obtained from Diffuse Lewy Body disease patients. These findings suggest that synphilin-1A may contribute to neuronal degeneration in alpha-synucleinopathies and also provide important insights into the role of inclusion bodies in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
