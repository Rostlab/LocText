Initial proteomics on the outer membrane from yeast mitochondria suggest that while most of the protein components are integral in the membrane, most of these mitochondrial proteins behave as if they have alpha-helical transmembrane domains, rather than beta-barrels. These proteins are usually predicted to have a single alpha-helical transmembrane segment at either the N- or C-terminus, however, more complex topologies are also seen. We purified the novel outer membrane protein Om14 and show it is encoded in the gene YBR230c. Protein sequencing revealed an intron is spliced from the transcript, and both transcription from the YBR230c gene and steady-state level of the Om14 protein is dramatically less in cells grown on glucose than in cells grown on nonfermentable carbon sources. Hydropathy predictions together with data from limited protease digestion show three alpha-helical transmembrane segments in Om14. The alpha-helical outer membrane proteins provide functions derived after the endosymbiotic event, and require the translocase in the outer mitochondrial membrane complex for insertion into the outer membrane.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":17},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":34,"end":62},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":66,"end":90},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":92,"end":104},"obj":"go:GO:0005739"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":165,"end":188},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":261,"end":269},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":297,"end":311},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":317,"end":322},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":323,"end":335},"obj":"go:GO:0005739"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":406,"end":414},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":430,"end":443},"obj":"go:GO:0005739"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":731,"end":745},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":754,"end":758},"obj":"uniprot:P38325"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":794,"end":801},"obj":"uniprot:P38325"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":905,"end":912},"obj":"uniprot:P38325"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":948,"end":952},"obj":"uniprot:P38325"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1191},"obj":"uniprot:P38325"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1211,"end":1225},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1327,"end":1355},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1387,"end":1401},"obj":"go:GO:0005741"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T17","obj":"T19"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
