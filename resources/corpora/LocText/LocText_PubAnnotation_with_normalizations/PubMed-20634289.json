They contain two calcium-dependent phospholipid binding C2 domains at the amino terminus and a VWA domain at the carboxyl terminus. The biological roles of most copines are not understood and the biochemical properties required for their functions are largely unknown. The Arabidopsis copine gene BON1/CPN1 is a negative regulator of cell death and defense responses. Here we probed the potential biochemical activities of BON1 through mutagenic studies. We found that mutations of aspartates in the C2 domains did not alter plasma membrane localization but compromised BON1 activity. Mutation at putative myristoylation residue glycine 2 altered plasma membrane localization of BON1 and rendered BON1 inactive. Mass spectrometry analysis of BON1 further suggests that the N-peptide of BON1 is modified. Furthermore, mutations that affect the interaction between BON1 and its functional partner BAP1 abolished BON1 function. This analysis reveals an unanticipated regulation of copine protein localization and function by calcium and lipid modification and suggests an important role in protein-protein interaction for the VWA domain of copines.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":95,"end":99},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":112,"end":123},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":506,"end":517},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":530,"end":534},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":535,"end":539},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":656,"end":660},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":758,"end":773},"obj":"go:GO:0005886"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":803,"end":807},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":880,"end":895},"obj":"go:GO:0005886"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":912,"end":916},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":930,"end":934},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":975,"end":979},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1019,"end":1023},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1100},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1132},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L2"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1147},"obj":"uniprot:Q941L3"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
