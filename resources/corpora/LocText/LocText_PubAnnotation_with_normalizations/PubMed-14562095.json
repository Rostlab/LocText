Here we describe the construction and analysis of a collection of yeast strains expressing full-length, chromosomally tagged green fluorescent protein fusion proteins. We classify these proteins, representing 75% of the yeast proteome, into 22 distinct subcellular localization categories, and provide localization information for 70% of previously unlocalized proteins. Analysis of this high-resolution, high-coverage localization data set in the context of transcriptional, genetic, and protein-protein interaction data helps reveal the logic of transcriptional co-regulation, and provides a comprehensive view of interactions within and between organelles in eukaryotic cells.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":51,"end":56},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":277,"end":282},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":315,"end":328},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":336,"end":361},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":431,"end":436},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
