PNS are mediated by immune reactions against autoantigen(s) shared by the cancer cells and the nervous system. By serological screening of a rat cerebellum cDNA expression library using anti-Hu-positive sera from three patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM), we identified an open reading frame encoding an isoform of the BTB-kelch protein KLHL7. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the KLHL7 protein is expressed in the nuclei of neurones, but not in other tissues including various cancers. However, the KLHL7 protein was detected in the nuclei of cancer cell lines. Antibodies to KLHL7 were detected by an immunoprecipitation assay in sera from 12 of 254 (4.7%) patients with various cancers and 2 of 170 blood donors (1.2%). None of 50 sera from patients with multiple sclerosis were positive for KLHL7 antibodies. Sixteen patients with classical PNS and anti-Hu or anti-Yo antibodies were also negative for KLHL7 antibodies. Seven cancer patients with KLHL7 antibodies had various signs of neurological disease that could be related to cancer, whereas the remaining five seropositive cancer patients had no clinical signs of possible PNS. The present results indicate that KLHL7 antibodies are associated with various cancers, and in some patients also with neurological disease. Whether KLHL7 antibodies can be used as paraneoplastic markers for PNS remains to be determined.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":53,"end":58},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"taxonomy:10116"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":562,"end":567},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":619,"end":624},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":653,"end":659},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":738,"end":743},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":772,"end":778},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":815,"end":820},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1038},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1144,"end":1149},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1189,"end":1194},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1410,"end":1415},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1525,"end":1530},"obj":"uniprot:Q5XHZ6"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
