In this study, we propose that in the cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptor, R3.50 in the DRY motif may be crucial for interacting with G proteins, and D3.49 and A6.34 may be important for constraining the receptor in an inactive conformation. To test our hypothesis, R3.50A, D3.49A, and A6.34E mutations of the human CB2 receptor were made by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutant receptors were stably transfected into human embryonic 293 cells, and their ligand binding and signal transduction properties were analyzed. Similar to other GPCRs, R3.50 of the CB2 receptor is crucial for signal transduction. Unlike other GPCRs, D3.49 and A6.34 of the CB2 receptor do not seem to be important for keeping the receptor in an inactive state. Furthermore, D3.49A and A6.34E mutations abolished ligand binding, and all three mutations abolished constitutive activity of the wild-type CB2 receptor.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":88,"end":116},"obj":"uniprot:P34972"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":410,"end":438},"obj":"uniprot:P34972"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":675,"end":680},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":681,"end":693},"obj":"uniprot:P34972"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":786,"end":791},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":925,"end":937},"obj":"uniprot:P34972"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1029},"obj":"uniprot:P34972"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1257},"obj":"uniprot:P34972"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
