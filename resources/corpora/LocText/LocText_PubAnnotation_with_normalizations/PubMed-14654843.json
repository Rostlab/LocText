It also has a crucial function in cell division because it determines the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregates duplicated chromosomes between dividing cells. Despite the importance of this organelle to cell biology and more than 100 years of study, many aspects of its function remain enigmatic and its structure and composition are still largely unknown. We performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human centrosomes in the interphase of the cell cycle by quantitatively profiling hundreds of proteins across several centrifugation fractions. True centrosomal proteins were revealed by both correlation with already known centrosomal proteins and in vivo localization. We identified and validated 23 novel components and identified 41 likely candidates as well as the vast majority of the known centrosomal proteins in a large background of nonspecific proteins. Protein correlation profiling permits the analysis of any multiprotein complex that can be enriched by fractionation but not purified to homogeneity.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":34,"end":39},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":40,"end":50},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":89,"end":99},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":113,"end":142},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":192,"end":204},"obj":"go:GO:0005856"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":350,"end":357},"obj":"go:GO:0005819"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":385,"end":396},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":680,"end":685},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":686,"end":697},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":829,"end":840},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":903,"end":914},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1087},"obj":"go:GO:0005815"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
