Here, we have identified human PIRH2 (hPIRH2) as a TIP60-interacting protein. To investigate its regulation, we characterized hPIRH2 in parallel with hPIRH2 variants possessing mutations of conserved RING finger residues. We observed that wild-type hPIRH2 is an unstable protein with a short half-life and is a target for RING domain-dependent proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, we found that hPIRH2 was ubiquitylated in cells. The TIP60-hPIRH2 association appeared to regulate hPIRH2 stability; coexpression of TIP60 enhanced hPIRH2 protein stability and altered hPIRH2 subcellular localization. These results suggest that hPIRH2 activities can be controlled, at the post-translational level, in multiple ways.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":16},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":22},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":57,"end":62},"obj":"uniprot:Q92993"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":83,"end":89},"obj":"taxonomy:10090"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":90,"end":95},"obj":"uniprot:Q9CR50"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":97,"end":103},"obj":"uniprot:Q9CR50"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":218,"end":221},"obj":"uniprot:P02340"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":230,"end":235},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":255,"end":261},"obj":"uniprot:Q9CR50"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":267,"end":270},"obj":"uniprot:P02340"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":319,"end":325},"obj":"uniprot:Q9CR50"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":371,"end":374},"obj":"uniprot:P02340"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"uniprot:P02340"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":412,"end":418},"obj":"uniprot:Q9CR50"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":477,"end":481},"obj":"uniprot:P23804"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":508,"end":513},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":514,"end":519},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":521,"end":527},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":534,"end":539},"obj":"uniprot:Q92993"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":609,"end":615},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":633,"end":639},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":732,"end":738},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":879,"end":885},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":918,"end":923},"obj":"uniprot:Q92993"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":924,"end":930},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":964,"end":970},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"obj":"uniprot:Q92993"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1019},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1050,"end":1056},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1116},"obj":"uniprot:Q96PM5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
