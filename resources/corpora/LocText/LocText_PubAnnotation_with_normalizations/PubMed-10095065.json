Here, we describe the cloning, expression, and molecular characterization of a truncated human homolog, tentatively named hCLCA3. It was cloned from a human spleen cDNA library and is expressed in numerous tissues including lung, trachea, spleen, thymus, and mammary gland as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Unlike all previously known CLCA family members which consistently encode an approximately 125-kDa transmembrane protein that is cleaved to form a heterodimer of two proteins of approximately 90 and 35 kDa, the 3.6-kb hCLCA3 mRNA encodes a 37-kDa glycoprotein that corresponds to the N-terminal extracellular domain of its homologs. Moreover, when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells, this 37-kDa glycoprotein is secreted into the culture supernatant. These observations suggest that hCLCA3 is a structurally divergent member of the CLCA family of proteins and that it does not act as a channel protein but has distinct, yet unidentified functions.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":67,"end":75},"obj":"go:GO:0005576"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":90,"end":95},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":228},"obj":"taxonomy:9913"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":230,"end":239},"obj":"uniprot:O18741"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":241,"end":247},"obj":"uniprot:Q3T0J2"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":254,"end":260},"obj":"taxonomy:10090"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":262,"end":268},"obj":"uniprot:Q9D7Z6"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":279,"end":284},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":286,"end":292},"obj":"uniprot:A8K7I4"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":297,"end":303},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UQC9"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":403,"end":408},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":436,"end":442},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6N3"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":465,"end":470},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":752,"end":765},"obj":"go:GO:0016020"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":871,"end":877},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6N3"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":948,"end":961},"obj":"go:GO:0005576"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1014,"end":1019},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1101,"end":1109},"obj":"go:GO:0005576"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1172,"end":1178},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6N3"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T18"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
