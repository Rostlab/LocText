We demonstrate here that, in human monocyte-derived DCs, the RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligase, membrane-associated RING-CH I (MARCH I), promotes the ubiquitination of the HLA-DR beta-chain. Thus, in nonactivated DCs, MARCH I induces the surface internalization of mature HLA-DR complexes, therefore reducing their stability and levels. We further demonstrate that the maturation-dependent down-regulation of MARCH I is a key event in MHC class II up-regulation at the surface of LPS-activated DCs. MARCH I is, therefore, a major regulator of HLA-DR traffic, and its loss contributes to the acquisition of the potent immunostimulatory properties of mature human DCs.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":34,"end":41},"obj":"go:GO:0009986"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":50},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":105,"end":112},"obj":"uniprot:Q8TCQ1"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":274,"end":286},"obj":"go:GO:0009986"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":334,"end":339},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":395,"end":424},"obj":"uniprot:Q8TCQ1"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":426,"end":433},"obj":"uniprot:Q8TCQ1"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":517,"end":524},"obj":"uniprot:Q8TCQ1"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":537,"end":544},"obj":"go:GO:0009986"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":708,"end":715},"obj":"uniprot:Q8TCQ1"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":768,"end":775},"obj":"go:GO:0009986"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":798,"end":805},"obj":"uniprot:Q8TCQ1"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":955,"end":960},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
