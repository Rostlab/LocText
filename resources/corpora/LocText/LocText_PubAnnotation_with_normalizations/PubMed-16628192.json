There are at least three transcripts that may result from different splicing of the pre-mRNA, but the differences among them are only involved in 5' non-translation region of HZF1 mRNA. HZF1 gene contains four exons and three introns. The putative protein consists of 670 amino-acid residues including 15 typical C2H2 and 2 C2RH zinc finger motifs. This structure characterization of HZF1 and the nuclear location of the protein suggest that HZF1 may function as a transcription factor. HZF1 mRNA expression was detected in ubiquitous tissues and various hematopoietic cell lines. Increased HZF1 mRNA expression was observed following erythroid differentiation of K562 cells induced by hemin or megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Both of the antisense method and RNA interference assay revealed that repression of the intrinsic expression of HZF1 blocked the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation and reduced the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, which suggested that HZF1 play important roles in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":68,"end":72},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":247,"end":252},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":549,"end":553},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":560,"end":564},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":758,"end":762},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":771,"end":778},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":861,"end":865},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":965,"end":969},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1270,"end":1274},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1426},"obj":"uniprot:P17020"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
