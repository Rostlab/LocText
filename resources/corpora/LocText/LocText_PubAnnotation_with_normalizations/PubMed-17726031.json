We report data on a human P4H possessing a transmembrane domain (P4H-TM). Its gene is also found in zebrafish but not in flies and nematodes. Its sequence more closely resembles those of the C-P4Hs than the HIF-P4Hs, but it lacks the peptide substrate-binding domain of the C-P4Hs. P4H-TM levels in cultured cells are increased by hypoxia, and P4H-TM is N-glycosylated and is located in endoplasmic reticulum membranes with its catalytic site inside the lumen, a location differing from those of the HIF-P4Hs. Despite this, P4H-TM overexpression in cultured neuroblastoma cells reduced HIF-alpha ODDD reporter construct levels, and its small interfering RNA increased HIF-1alpha protein level, in the same way as those of HIF-P4Hs. Furthermore, recombinant P4H-TM hydroxylated the two critical prolines in HIF-1alpha ODDD in vitro, with a preference for the C-terminal proline, whereas it did not hydroxylate any prolines in recombinant type I procollagen chains.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":3,"end":24},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":59},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NXG6"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":346,"end":351},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":369,"end":382},"obj":"go:GO:0016021"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":391,"end":397},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NXG6"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":426,"end":435},"obj":"taxonomy:7955"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":447,"end":452},"obj":"taxonomy:7227"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":457,"end":466},"obj":"taxonomy:6239"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NXG6"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":670,"end":676},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NXG6"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":713,"end":744},"obj":"go:GO:0005789"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":780,"end":785},"obj":"go:GO:0005788"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":850,"end":856},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NXG6"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":994,"end":1004},"obj":"uniprot:Q16665"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1083,"end":1089},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NXG6"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1142},"obj":"uniprot:Q16665"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
