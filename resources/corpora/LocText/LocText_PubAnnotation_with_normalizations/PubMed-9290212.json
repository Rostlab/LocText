These regions represent 203 kilobases corresponding to approximately one-fifth of the complete yeast chromosome VII. Two fragments originate from the left arm of this chromosome. The first one of about 15.8 kb starts approximately 75 kb from the left telomere and is bordered by the SK18 chromosomal marker. The second fragment covers the 72.6 kb region between the chromosomal markers CYH2 and ALG2. On the right chromosomal arm three regions, a 70.6 kb region between the MSB2 and the KSS1 chromosomal markers and two smaller regions dominated by the KRE11 marker and another one in the vicinity of the SER2 marker were sequenced. We found a total of 114 open reading frames (ORFs), 13 of which were completely overlapping with larger ORFs running in the opposite direction. A total of 44 yeast genes, the physiological functions of which are known, could be precisely mapped on this chromosome. Of the remaining 57 ORFs, 26 shared sequence homologies with known genes, among which were 13 other S. cerevisiae genes and five genes from other organisms. No homology with any sequence in the databases could be found for 31 ORFs. Furthermore, five Ty elements were found, one of which may not be functional due to a frame shift in its Ty1B amino acid sequence. The five chromosomal regions harboured five potential ARS elements and one sigma element together with eight tRNA genes and two snRNAs, one of which is encoded by an intron of a protein-coding gene.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":40,"end":64},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":65,"end":75},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":133,"end":143},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":151,"end":175},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":306,"end":311},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":312,"end":322},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":378,"end":388},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":462,"end":470},"obj":"go:GO:0000781"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":499,"end":510},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":577,"end":588},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":597,"end":601},"obj":"uniprot:P02406"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":606,"end":610},"obj":"uniprot:P43636"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":625,"end":636},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":685,"end":689},"obj":"uniprot:P32334"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":698,"end":702},"obj":"uniprot:P14681"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":703,"end":714},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":764,"end":769},"obj":"uniprot:P32893"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":816,"end":820},"obj":"uniprot:P42941"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1007},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1097,"end":1107},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1209,"end":1222},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1446,"end":1450},"obj":"uniprot:Q12490"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1492},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
