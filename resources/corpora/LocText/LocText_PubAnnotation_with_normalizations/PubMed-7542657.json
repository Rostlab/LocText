B., A. Rao, M. J. Fritzler, D. W. Valencia, and T. J. Yen. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 26:214-226). We report here the human cDNA sequence of CENP-F, along with its expression and localization patterns at different stages of the HeLa cell cycle. CENP-F is protein of the nuclear matrix that gradually accumulates during the cell cycle until it reaches peak levels in G2 and M phase cells and is rapidly degraded upon completion of mitosis. CENP-F is first detected at the prekinetochore complex during late G2, and is clearly detectable as paired foci that correspond to all the centromeres by prophase. During mitosis, CENP-F is associated with kinetochores from prometaphase until early anaphase and is then detected at the spindle midzone throughout the remainder of anaphase. By telophase, CENP-F is concentrated within the intracellular bridge at either side of the mid-body. The predicted structure of the 367-kD CENP-F protein consists of two 1,600-amino acid-long coil domains that flank a central flexible core. A putative P-loop nucleotide binding site (ADIPTGKT) is located within the globular carboxy terminus. The structural features deduced from our sequence studies and the spatial and temperal distribution of CENP-F revealed in our cytological and biochemical studies suggest that it may play a role in several mitotic events.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":41},"obj":"go:GO:0016363"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":62,"end":74},"obj":"go:GO:0000777"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":125,"end":145},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":147,"end":153},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":168,"end":179},"obj":"go:GO:0000777"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":324,"end":336},"obj":"go:GO:0005856"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":370,"end":375},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":393,"end":399},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":497,"end":503},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":522,"end":536},"obj":"go:GO:0016363"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":691,"end":697},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":723,"end":737},"obj":"go:GO:0000777"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":830,"end":841},"obj":"go:GO:0000775"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":871,"end":877},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":897,"end":909},"obj":"go:GO:0000777"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1051},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1170,"end":1176},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1477,"end":1483},"obj":"uniprot:P49454"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R8","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R9","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
