{"target":"http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/15072822","sourcedb":"PubMed","sourceid":"15072822","text":"Expression and localization of ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I-1 (E-NPP1/PC-1) and -3 (E-NPP3/CD203c/PD-Ibeta/B10/gp130(RB13-6)) in inflammatory and neoplastic bile duct diseases.\nEcto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-I enzyme (E-NPP) consists of three closely related molecules: E-NPP1, E-NPP2 and E-NPP3. We investigated the expression and localization of E-NPP1 and -3 in human inflammatory and neoplastic bile duct diseases. Immunohistochemically E-NPP1 was located on the apical cytoplasmic side of cancer cells, whereas E-NPP3 was located in the apical plasma membrane. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of E-NPP3, but not E-NPP1, was higher in tumor tissues than in surrounding tissues and the specific form of the E-NPP3 protein was readily detected in the sera of bile duct carcinoma (BDC) patients. Furthermore, it was confirmed that E-NPP3 was associated with migration ability by using of NIH3T3 cells that stably transfected with E-NPP3 cDNA. These results suggest that E-NPP3 is involved in the infiltration of neoplastic BDC and is possible to be a tumor marker.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":84},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":86,"end":92},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":97},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":103,"end":105},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":107,"end":113},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":114,"end":120},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":121,"end":129},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":134,"end":147},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":312,"end":318},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":320,"end":326},"obj":"uniprot:Q13822"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":331,"end":337},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":390,"end":403},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":390,"end":403},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":407,"end":412},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":483,"end":489},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":516,"end":527},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":558,"end":564},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":584,"end":606},"obj":"go:GO:0016324"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":662,"end":668},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":678,"end":684},"obj":"uniprot:P22413"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":771,"end":777},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":893,"end":899},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":992,"end":998},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1038},"obj":"uniprot:O14638"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T18","obj":"T19"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
