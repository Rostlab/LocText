We investigated the control of COP1 partitioning between nucleus and cytoplasm, which has been implicated in the regulation of COP1 activity, by using fusion proteins between COP1 and beta-glucuronidase or the green fluorescent protein. Transient expression assays using onion epidermal cells and data from hypocotyl cells of stably transformed Arabidopsis demonstrated that COP1 carries a single, bipartite nuclear localization signal that functions independently of light. Nuclear exclusion was mediated by a novel and distinct signal, bordering the zinc-finger and coiled-coil motifs, that was able to redirect a heterologous nuclear protein to the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization signal functioned in a light-independent manner. Light regulation of nuclear localization was reconstituted by combining the individual domains containing the nuclear localization signal and the cytoplasmic localization signal; the WD-40 repeat domain of COP1 was not required. However, phenotypic analysis of transgenic seedlings suggested that the constitutively nuclear-localized WD-40 repeat domain was able to mimic aspects of COP1 function, as indicated by exaggerated hypocotyl elongation under light conditions.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":53},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":58,"end":69},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":86,"end":97},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":98,"end":102},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":108,"end":119},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":120,"end":150},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":152,"end":156},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":235,"end":246},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":300,"end":304},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":326,"end":333},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":338,"end":347},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":396,"end":400},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":444,"end":448},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":453,"end":471},"obj":"uniprot:Q93VY4"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":479,"end":504},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":540,"end":545},"obj":"taxonomy:4679"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":614,"end":625},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":644,"end":648},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":677,"end":684},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":744,"end":751},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":898,"end":905},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":921,"end":930},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":936,"end":947},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1037},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1127},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1167},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1216,"end":1220},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1333},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1393,"end":1397},"obj":"uniprot:P43254"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T29","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T18","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R8","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T27","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R9","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T27","obj":"T26"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
