It is expressed in a variety of human tissues, and mRNA levels are upregulated in nondividing senescent and quiescent human fibroblasts. Overexpression of the protein in quiescent cells stimulated with serum growth factors results in inhibition of entry into the cell cycle. The latter activity is lost when the N-terminal KRAB domain is deleted. The KRAB domain is also required for the transcriptional repression activity of ZFQR and in maintaining association of the protein with the nuclear matrix. The gene has been mapped to human chromosome 19q13.4. The association of ZFQR with the nuclear matrix, transcriptional repression activity, increased expression in senescent and quiescent cells, and the ability to inhibit quiescent cells stimulated with growth factors from entering the cell cycle suggests a role for ZFQR in the maintenance of the nondividing state of normal human cells.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"obj":"uniprot:Q9GZX5"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":354,"end":359},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":440,"end":445},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":749,"end":753},"obj":"uniprot:Q9GZX5"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":809,"end":823},"obj":"go:GO:0016363"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":853,"end":858},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":859,"end":869},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":898,"end":902},"obj":"uniprot:Q9GZX5"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":912,"end":926},"obj":"go:GO:0016363"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1147},"obj":"uniprot:Q9GZX5"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1202,"end":1207},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
