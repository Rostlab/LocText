Here, we tested the hypothesis that the beta4 integrin-associated plakin protein, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1e (BPAG1e) functions as a scaffold for Rac1/cofilin signal transduction. We generated keratinocyte lines exhibiting a stable knockdown in BPAG1e expression. Knockdown of BPAG1e does not affect expression levels of other hemidesmosomal proteins, nor the amount of beta4 integrin expressed at the cell surface. However, the amount of Rac1 associating with beta4 integrin and the activity of both Rac1 and cofilin are significantly lower in BPAG1e-deficient cells compared with wild-type keratinocytes. In addition, keratinocytes deficient in BPAG1e exhibit loss of front-to-rear polarity and display aberrant motility. These defects are rescued by inducing expression of constitutively active Rac1 or active cofilin. These data indicate that the BPAG1e is required for efficient regulation of keratinocyte polarity and migration by determining the activation of Rac1.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":47,"end":61},"obj":"uniprot:P16144"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":85,"end":89},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":114,"end":134},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":233,"end":237},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":317,"end":331},"obj":"uniprot:P16144"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":359,"end":388},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":390,"end":396},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":426,"end":430},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":525,"end":531},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":557,"end":563},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":650,"end":664},"obj":"uniprot:P16144"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":682,"end":694},"obj":"go:GO:0009986"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":719,"end":723},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":741,"end":755},"obj":"uniprot:P16144"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":781,"end":785},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":825,"end":831},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":927,"end":933},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1078,"end":1082},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1131,"end":1137},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1247,"end":1251},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
