We assessed the interactions between different hemidesmosomal components with each other, mapped the binding sites and studied the importance of these interactions for HD assembly in yeast two-hybrid and cell-transfection assays. The results show that: (1) bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP) 180 binds not only to BP230, but also to plectin. The interactions between these proteins are facilitated by the Y subdomain in the N-terminal plakin domain of BP230 and plectin, and residues 145-230 of the cytoplasmic domain of BP180; (2) different, but overlapping, sequences on BP180 mediate binding to beta4, which, in turn associates with BP180 via its third fibronectin type III repeat; (3) sequences in the N-terminal extremity of BP230 mediate its binding to beta4, which requires the C-terminal end of the connecting segment up to the fourth FNIII repeat of the beta4 subunit. (4) Finally, cell-transfection studies showed that the localization of BP230 into hemidesmosome-like structures depends on its Z-Y subdomains as well as on the availability of BP180. By having further uncovered interactions between various hemidesmosomal components, mapped the involved binding sites and dissected a hierarchy of interactions relevant for their topogenic fate, our findings give novel insights into the molecular organization of hemidesmosomes.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":42},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UMD9"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":44,"end":49},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":51,"end":58},"obj":"uniprot:Q15149"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":67,"end":87},"obj":"uniprot:P16144"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":242,"end":262},"obj":"go:GO:0005578"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":447,"end":452},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":521,"end":556},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UMD9"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":575,"end":580},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":594,"end":601},"obj":"uniprot:Q15149"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":713,"end":718},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":723,"end":730},"obj":"uniprot:Q15149"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":760,"end":771},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":782,"end":787},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UMD9"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":834,"end":839},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UMD9"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":859,"end":864},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":897,"end":902},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UMD9"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":991,"end":996},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1020,"end":1025},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1129},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1210,"end":1215},"obj":"uniprot:Q03001"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1320},"obj":"uniprot:Q9UMD9"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T13","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
