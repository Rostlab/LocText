PDGF-C expressed nuclear localisation in 95% of all tested cell types in culture and in 10% of the thyrocytes from both PTC and non-neoplastic tissue. The cell lines expressed two forms of full-length PDGF-C, approximately 39 and approximately 55 kDa, in cell membrane and cytosol, while the approximately 55 kDa form dominated in the nucleus where it was partly chromatin-associated. The approximately 55 kDa form was post-translationally modified by SUMO-1. The putative PDGF-C SUMOylation site is the surface exposed (314)lysine part of a positively charged loop ((312)RPKTGVRGLHK(322)) with characteristics of a nuclear localisation signal. The tissue thyrocytes expressed a non-SUMOylated approximately 43 kDa and the 55 kDa PDGF-C. The SUMO-1 modified approximately 55 kDa PDGF-C expression was low in PTC where the approximately 43 kDa PDGF-C dominated. This is in contrast to non-neoplastic tissue and cultured cells where the SUMOylated approximately 55 kDa PDGF-C was strongly expressed. Our data provide novel evidence for nuclear localisation of PDGF-C, post-translational modification by SUMOylation and the expression of a novel form of PDGF-C in human papillary thyroid carcinomas.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":35,"end":41},"obj":"uniprot:P63165"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":51,"end":57},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":61,"end":66},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":189,"end":221},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":223,"end":229},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":348,"end":354},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":365,"end":372},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":549,"end":555},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":603,"end":616},"obj":"go:GO:0005886"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":621,"end":628},"obj":"go:GO:0005829"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":683,"end":690},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":800,"end":806},"obj":"uniprot:P63165"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":821,"end":827},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":964,"end":971},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1078,"end":1084},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1096},"obj":"uniprot:P63165"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1127,"end":1133},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1191,"end":1197},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1321},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1382,"end":1389},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1406,"end":1412},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1499,"end":1505},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NRA1"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1509,"end":1514},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R6","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R7","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T23","obj":"T22"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
