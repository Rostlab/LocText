Using the coat protein II (COPII) mutant sec31-1, we visualized ER exit sites (ERES) and identified three distinct ERES populations in vivo. One contains glycosylated pro-alpha-factor, the second contains the GPI-anchored proteins Cwp2p, Ccw14p and Tos6p and the third is enriched with the hexose transporter, Hxt1p. Concentration of GPI-anchored proteins prior to budding requires anchor remodeling, and Hxt1p incorporation into ERES requires the COPII components Sec12p and Sec16p. Additionally, we have found that GPI-anchored protein ER exit is controlled by the p24 family member Emp24p, whereas ER export of most transmembrane proteins requires the Cornichon homologue Erv14p.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":46},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":55,"end":60},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":138,"end":159},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":161,"end":163},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":172,"end":177},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":178,"end":202},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":350,"end":352},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":517,"end":522},"obj":"uniprot:P43497"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":524,"end":530},"obj":"uniprot:O13547"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":535,"end":540},"obj":"uniprot:P48560"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":596,"end":601},"obj":"uniprot:P32465"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":691,"end":696},"obj":"uniprot:P32465"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":751,"end":757},"obj":"uniprot:P11655"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":762,"end":768},"obj":"uniprot:P48415"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":824,"end":826},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":871,"end":877},"obj":"uniprot:E7Q3M8"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":887,"end":889},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":961,"end":967},"obj":"uniprot:P53173"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T11","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
