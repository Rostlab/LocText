By using this strategy, NFAT activating molecule 1 (NFAM1) was cloned as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing cell surface molecule belonging to the Ig superfamily and is predominantly expressed in spleen B and T cells. NFAM1 crosslinking induced ITAM phosphorylation, ZAP-70/Syk recruitment, NFAT activation, and cytokine production. In vivo overexpression of NFAM1 in bone marrow chimeras and transgenic mice induced severe impairment of early B cell development in an ITAM-dependent manner. In NFAM1-expressing B cells, B cell antigen receptor stimulation induced NFAM1 translocation to lipid raft, and NFAM1 co-crosslinking augmented B cell antigen receptor signaling. The results suggest that NFAM1 modulates B cell signaling through its ITAM, which regulates B cell development.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":237,"end":244},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":375,"end":401},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":403,"end":408},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":489,"end":501},"obj":"go:"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":599,"end":604},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":648,"end":654},"obj":"uniprot:P43404"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":655,"end":658},"obj":"uniprot:P48025"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":740,"end":745},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":785,"end":789},"obj":"taxonomy:10090"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":876,"end":881},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":946,"end":951},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":969,"end":979},"obj":"go:GO:0045121"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":985,"end":990},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1077,"end":1082},"obj":"uniprot:Q8R4V1"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
