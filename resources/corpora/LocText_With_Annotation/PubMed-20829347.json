ER stress mediators, including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), are elevated in intestinal epithelia from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. The present study arose from the question of how chemical ER stress and CHOP protein were associated with nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated epithelial inflammatory response. In a human intestinal epithelial cell culture model, chemical ER stresses induced proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and the nuclear translocation of CHOP protein. CHOP was positively involved in ER-activated IL-8 production and was negatively associated with expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). ER stress-induced IL-8 production was enhanced by NF-\u03baB activation that was negatively regulated by PPAR\u03b3. Mechanistically, ER stress-induced CHOP suppressed PPAR\u03b3 transcription by sequestering C/EBP\u03b2 and limiting availability of C/EBP\u03b2 binding to the PPAR\u03b3 promoter. Due to the CHOP-mediated regulation of PPAR\u03b3 action, ER stress can enhance proinflammatory NF-\u03baB activation and maintain an increased level of IL-8 production in human intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, PPAR\u03b3 was a counteracting regulator of gut inflammatory response through attenuation of NF-\u03baB activation. The collective results support the view that balances between CHOP and PPAR\u03b3 are crucial for epithelial homeostasis, and disruption of these balances in mucosal ER stress can etiologically affect the progress of human inflammatory bowel diseases.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":21},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":73,"end":80},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":121,"end":169},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":171,"end":192},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":194,"end":196},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":259,"end":261},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":349,"end":353},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":499,"end":501},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":513,"end":517},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":547,"end":554},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":621,"end":626},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":678,"end":680},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":723,"end":736},"obj":"uniprot:P10145"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":738,"end":742},"obj":"uniprot:P10145"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":763,"end":770},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":788,"end":792},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":802,"end":806},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":834,"end":836},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":847,"end":851},"obj":"uniprot:P10145"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":912,"end":956},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":958,"end":963},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":966,"end":968},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":984,"end":988},"obj":"uniprot:P10145"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1071},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1092},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1108,"end":1112},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1129},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1166},"obj":"uniprot:P17676"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1196,"end":1202},"obj":"uniprot:P17676"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1223},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1249},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1278},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1287,"end":1289},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1381},"obj":"uniprot:P10145"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1396,"end":1401},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1444,"end":1449},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1612,"end":1616},"obj":"uniprot:P35638"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1621,"end":1626},"obj":"uniprot:P37231"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1713},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1762,"end":1767},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T28","obj":"T15"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
