Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein (IMP) zip code-binding proteins participate in mRNA localization, and in motile cells IMP-containing granules are dispersed around the nucleus and in cellular protrusions. We isolated the IMP1-containing RNP granules and found that they represent a unique RNP entity distinct from neuronal hStaufen and/or fragile X mental retardation protein granules, processing bodies, and stress granules. Granules were 100-300 nm in diameter and consisted of IMPs, 40 S ribosomal subunits, shuttling heterologous nuclear RNPs, poly(A)-binding proteins, and mRNAs. Moreover granules contained CBP80 and factors belonging to the exon junction complex and lacked eIF4E, eIF4G, and 60 S ribosomal subunits, indicating that embodied mRNAs are not translated. Granules embodied mRNAs corresponding to about 3% of the human embryonic kidney 293 mRNA transcriptome. Messenger RNAs encoding proteins participating in the secretory pathway and endoplasmic reticulum-associated quality control, as well as ubiquitin-dependent metabolism, were enriched in the granules, reinforcing the concept of RNP granules as post-transcriptional operons.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":25,"end":29},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NZI8"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":415,"end":422},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":430,"end":450},"obj":"go:GO:0042995"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":468,"end":472},"obj":"uniprot:Q9NZI8"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":781,"end":788},"obj":"go:GO:0005634"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":860,"end":865},"obj":"uniprot:Q09161"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":928,"end":933},"obj":"uniprot:P06730"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":935,"end":940},"obj":"uniprot:Q04637"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1079,"end":1084},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1180,"end":1189},"obj":"go:GO:0005576"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1202,"end":1223},"obj":"go:GO:0005783"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
