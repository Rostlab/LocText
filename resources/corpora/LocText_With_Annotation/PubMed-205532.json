These enzymes could clearly be divided into two groups. The first group comprised the five enzymes of the acetylated compound cycle, i.e., acetylglutamate synthase, acetylglutamate kinase, acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase, acetylornithine aminotransferase, and acetylornithine-glutamate acetyltransferase. These enzymes were exclusively particulate. Comparison with citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase, and results from isopycnic gradient analysis, suggested that these enzymes were associated with the mitochondria. By contrast, enzymatic activities going from ornithine to arginine, i.e., arginine pathway-specific carbamoylphosphate synthetase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, argininosuccinate synthetase, and argininosuccinate lyase, and the two first catabolic enzymes, arginase and ornithine aminotransferase, were in the \"soluble\" fraction of the cell.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":47},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":152,"end":176},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":405,"end":429},"obj":"uniprot:P40360"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":431,"end":453},"obj":"uniprot:Q01217"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":455,"end":489},"obj":"uniprot:Q01217"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":491,"end":523},"obj":"uniprot:P18544"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":529,"end":573},"obj":"uniprot:Q04728"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":634,"end":650},"obj":"uniprot:P00890"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":655,"end":673},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":775,"end":787},"obj":"go:GO:0005739"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":863,"end":918},"obj":"uniprot:P07258"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":920,"end":950},"obj":"uniprot:P05150"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":952,"end":980},"obj":"uniprot:P22768"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":986,"end":1009},"obj":"uniprot:P04076"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1056},"obj":"uniprot:P00812"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1061,"end":1087},"obj":"uniprot:P07991"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T7","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R7","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
