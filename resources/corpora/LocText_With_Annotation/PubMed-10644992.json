For this reason, we conducted a computerized sequence homology search for novel acetyltransferases. Here, we show that the putative tumour suppressor protein Fus-2 has homology to the catalytic domain of acetyltransferases. We demonstrate that Fus-2 can acetylate the N-terminus of proteins using a ping-pong mechanism and that it has a specificity for substrates. Consistent with other N-acetyltransferases, Fus-2 localizes to the cytoplasm, as shown by GFP-tag experiments. Since the Fus-2 gene maps to the chromosomal region 3p21.3, which contains at least one tumour suppressor gene, the N-acetyltransferase functions of Fus-2 may be relevant to its potential role in cancer.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":36},"obj":"uniprot:Q93015"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":407,"end":412},"obj":"uniprot:Q93015"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":493,"end":498},"obj":"uniprot:Q93015"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"obj":"uniprot:Q93015"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":681,"end":690},"obj":"go:GO:0005737"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":704,"end":707},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":735,"end":740},"obj":"uniprot:Q93015"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":758,"end":769},"obj":"go:GO:0005694"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":874,"end":879},"obj":"uniprot:Q93015"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
