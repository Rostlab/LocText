The genomic organization of human multidrug resistance-associated protein 7 (MRP7) was identified. The human MRP7 gene, consisting of 22 exons and 21 introns, greatly differs from other members of the human MRP subfamily. A splicing variant of human MRP7, MRP7A, expressed in most human tissues, was also characterized. The 1.93-kb promoter region of MRP7 was isolated and shown to support luciferase activity at a level 4- to 5-fold greater than that of the SV40 promoter. Basal MRP7 gene expression was regulated by 2 regions in the 5'-flanking region at -1,780-1,287 bp, and at -611 to -208 bp. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, MRP7 promoter activity was increased by 226% by genotoxic 2-acetylaminofluorene and 347% by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A. The protein was expressed in the membrane fraction of transfected MDCK cells.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":61,"end":66},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":67,"end":108},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":310,"end":315},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":316,"end":357},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":359,"end":363},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":385,"end":390},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":391,"end":395},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":483,"end":488},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":526,"end":531},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":532,"end":536},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":538,"end":543},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":563,"end":568},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":633,"end":637},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":762,"end":766},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":923,"end":927},"obj":"uniprot:Q5T3U5"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1050,"end":1064},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1107},"obj":"go:GO:0016020"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T11","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T17"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
