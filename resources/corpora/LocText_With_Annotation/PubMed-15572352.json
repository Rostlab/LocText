ATP-dependent uptake of histidine and lysine by isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles was impaired in YMR088c, a vacuolar basic amino acid transporter 1 (VBA1)-deleted strain, whereas uptake of tyrosine or calcium was little affected. This defect in histidine and lysine uptake was complemented fully by introducing the VBA1 gene and partially by a gene encoding Vba1p fused with green fluorescent protein, which was determined to localize exclusively to the vacuolar membrane. A defect in the uptake of histidine, lysine, or arginine was also observed in the vacuolar membrane vesicles of mutants YBR293w (VBA2) and YCL069w (VBA3). These three VBA genes are closely related phylogenetically and constitute a new family of basic amino acid transporters in the yeast vacuole.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":49,"end":66},"obj":"go:GO:0005774"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":72,"end":96},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":156,"end":180},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":233,"end":241},"obj":"go:GO:0005773"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":357,"end":374},"obj":"go:GO:0005774"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":400,"end":407},"obj":"uniprot:Q04301"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":411,"end":450},"obj":"uniprot:Q04301"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":452,"end":456},"obj":"uniprot:Q04301"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":618,"end":622},"obj":"uniprot:Q04301"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"obj":"uniprot:Q04301"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":678,"end":703},"obj":"uniprot:uniprot:"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":757,"end":774},"obj":"go:GO:0005774"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":858,"end":875},"obj":"go:GO:0005774"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":896,"end":903},"obj":"uniprot:P38358"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":905,"end":909},"obj":"uniprot:P38358"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":915,"end":922},"obj":"uniprot:P25594"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":924,"end":928},"obj":"uniprot:P25594"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1058,"end":1063},"obj":"taxonomy:4932"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1071},"obj":"go:GO:0005773"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R10","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T16","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T17","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T7","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R8","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"localizeTo","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
