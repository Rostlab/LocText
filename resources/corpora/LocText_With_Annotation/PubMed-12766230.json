To provide the most exhaustive view of the protein repertoire of chloroplast envelope membranes, we analyzed this membrane system using proteomics. To this purpose, we first developed a procedure to prepare highly purified envelope membranes from Arabidopsis chloroplasts. We then extracted envelope proteins using different methods, i.e. chloroform/methanol extraction and alkaline or saline treatments, in order to retrieve as many proteins as possible, from the most to least hydrophobic ones. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses were then performed on each envelope membrane subfraction, leading to the identification of more than 100 proteins. About 80% of the identified proteins are known to be, or are very likely, located in the chloroplast envelope. The validation of localization in the envelope of two phosphate transporters exemplifies the need for a combination of strategies to perform the most exhaustive identification of genuine chloroplast envelope proteins. Interestingly, some of the identified proteins are found to be Nalpha-acetylated, which indicates the accurate location of the N terminus of the corresponding mature protein. With regard to function, more than 50% of the identified proteins have functions known or very likely to be associated with the chloroplast envelope. These proteins are a) involved in ion and metabolite transport, b) components of the protein import machinery, and c) involved in chloroplast lipid metabolism. Some soluble proteins, like proteases, proteins involved in carbon metabolism, or proteins involved in responses to oxidative stress, were associated with envelope membranes. Almost one-third of the proteins we identified have no known function. The present work helps understanding chloroplast envelope metabolism at the molecular level and provides a new overview of the biochemical machinery of the chloroplast envelope membranes.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":38},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":39,"end":48},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":74},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":95,"end":107},"obj":"go:GO:0009507"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":252,"end":260},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":261,"end":270},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":337,"end":357},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":358,"end":367},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":386,"end":394},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":495,"end":503},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":504,"end":513},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":519,"end":530},"obj":"taxonomy:3702"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":531,"end":543},"obj":"go:GO:0009507"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":563,"end":571},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":853,"end":861},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":862,"end":870},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1050},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1098},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1239,"end":1259},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1593},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1725,"end":1736},"obj":"go:GO:0009507"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1910,"end":1918},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1919,"end":1928},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2038,"end":2058},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2157,"end":2177},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2178,"end":2187},"obj":"go:GO:0009941"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
