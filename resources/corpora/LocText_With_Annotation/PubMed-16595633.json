We previously demonstrated that synphilin-1 interacts with alpha-synuclein, implying a role in Parkinson's disease. We now report the identification and characterization of synphilin-1A, an isoform of synphilin-1, which has enhanced aggregatory properties and causes neurotoxicity. The two transcripts encoding synphilin-1A and synphilin-1 originate from the SNCAIP gene but differ in both their exon organization and initial reading frames used for translation. Synphilin-1A binds to alpha-synuclein and induces the formation of intracellular aggregates in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, primary neuronal cultures, and human dopaminergic cells. Overexpression of synphilin-1A in neurons results in striking cellular toxicity that is attenuated by the formation of synphilin-1A inclusions, which recruit alpha-synuclein. Synphilin-1A is present in Lewy bodies of patients with Parkinson's disease and Diffuse Lewy Body disease, and is observed in detergent-insoluble fractions of brain protein samples obtained from Diffuse Lewy Body disease patients. These findings suggest that synphilin-1A may contribute to neuronal degeneration in alpha-synucleinopathies and also provide important insights into the role of inclusion bodies in neurodegenerative disorders.","project":"LocText","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":12},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":46,"end":57},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":288,"end":303},"obj":"uniprot:P37840"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":337,"end":348},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":364,"end":379},"obj":"uniprot:P37840"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":478,"end":490},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":506,"end":517},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":616,"end":628},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":633,"end":644},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":664,"end":670},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":768,"end":780},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":790,"end":805},"obj":"uniprot:P37840"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":863,"end":868},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":928,"end":933},"obj":"taxonomy:9606"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":972,"end":984},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1085},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1127},"obj":"uniprot:P37840"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1129,"end":1141},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1400},"obj":"uniprot:Q9Y6H5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"uniprot","uri":"http://identifiers.org/uniprot/"},{"prefix":"taxonomy","uri":"http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/"},{"prefix":"go","uri":"http://identifiers.org/go/"}]}
